This is a readme for the GifTastic generator.

It's very straightforward. The user types in a keyword, a button for that keyword is added to the existing buttons, and by clicking on a button, gif results are returned for that keyword. By clicking on the gif, you can change the state of the gif to active, meaning the gif will play, or still, meaning the gif will be a still picture.

Thanks!
